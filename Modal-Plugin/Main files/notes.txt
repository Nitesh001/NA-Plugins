Instructions to use this plugin:

1) Include na.plugin.modal.min.css and na.plugin.modal.min.js file in your main HTML file.
2) After including, call "na.modal.init(args)" method whenever you want to open modalbox.
3) "init" method expects an argument. This is an object with an essential field, "modal-box". 
For eg,
na.modal.init({
	"modal-box" : "modalContent"
});
Here, modalContent is an id of content div that you want to display as modal.

4) That's it, smile :)
